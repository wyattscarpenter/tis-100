# About this repo

My tis-100 solutions. Yes, this is just the save folder on my computer. But, it's also programs. Really makes you think. Anyway, my solutions aren't special or especially good or anything, I just enjoy having them.

There is no particular reason why you should be interested in this repo unless you are me. With that said, I will discuss various topics about TIS-100 in this readme.

This repo is stored on my computer both in my big folder of git repos, and in the TIS save file location in C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\TIS-100 . It's also on my github.

I don't know why this is the case, but the structure of the TIS-100 save folder seems to be:

 * everything in `0/` (perhaps this is some kind of user-profile and I am user 0? I don't see any way to make a new profile)
   * my solutions can be found in `save/`
   * my custom levels in `custom/` (at time of writing I've never made any custom levels, but you can look at the empty one I accidentally made and then deleted -.- )
   * various random summary statistics in `save.dat` and `log.dat` (I've decided to gitignore the `log-*.temp` files; they seem to be compressed (some format beginning with `xÚ3` ? Wikipedia tells us this is zlib “Best Compression (no preset dictionary)”, which begins with hexadecimal `78 DA` ie ISO 8859-1 `xÚ`) copies of old log files, and are probably not important to keep)

I've licensed this repo as public domain, but that ONLY applies to content I've created, not TIS-100 itself (nor, I suppose, the lua code that is automatically generated by the game for custom levels, although that might be de minimus).

## Additional resources about TIS

* Official website, with links to how to buy the game: https://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/
* The "TIS-100 Reference Manual.pdf" that comes with the game. It is also available as (crtl-f'able!) markdown here: https://github.com/archsyril/tis100-manual
* the separate document "Tessellated Intelligence System Best Practices - Patterns of Node Communication", which is ficticious, which is frequently refered to in the TIS-100 Reference Manual.
* A TIS-100 guide some people wrote that takes its name from the above fictional document: https://kk4ead.github.io/tis-100/
* This other TIS-100 guide someone wrote: https://alandesmet.github.io/TIS-100-Hackers-Guide/
* Various things on https://tis100.complexity.nl/
* https://old.reddit.com/r/tis100/ sometimes the subreddits for a game have a lot of useful info in them. This one is more concerned with record-keeping, I guess. This is pretty interesting for internal details of the TIS challenges: https://www.reddit.com/r/tis100/comments/3y7ssa/real_challenge_specifications/

## Personal thoughts, reflections, evaluations, of TIS-100, Zachtronics, programming games, and maybe just maybe life itself

I don't really like Zachtronics games, but this one in particular speaks to me for some reason. It's probably the font.

I will probably never delete this game off of my hard drive, for fear of losing it.

I might write something more here later, but probably not!

## Stage layout details
These save files are somewhat useless unless you also have TIS-100, because the layout of the stages is not uniform, and as far as I know there's no standard for the metadata to encode such things (though one could be easily made, I'm sure). I hear there used to be something called "TIS100pad.com", a website that dealt in this sort of thing, but it seems to be lost to the sands of time I'm afraid.

Someone could re-implement TIS to make it extremely responsive and not Unity, since the graphics are very basic. But this would be something of a fool's errand, because no additional TIS implementation is strictly speaking needed. You would just be doing a lot of work because it occured to you that it was something that could be done. I'm trying to disuade myself, here. It looks like someone has already done something like this, in Rust, which is also how I would do it. So that's cool: https://github.com/wfraser/tis100-rs Actually a number of people have done this: https://github.com/topics/tis-100
